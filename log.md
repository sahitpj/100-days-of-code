# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS on personal website. Created a Pull Request to NLTK, adding my smoothing functions

**Thoughts:** The CSS was a simple fix. The NLTK pullrequest required me to study the existing smoothing models already present. Overall I added my patch and fixed a few errors which I found in the package
